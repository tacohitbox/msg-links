      <h2>Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        MsgLinks cares about your privacy. Absolutely no frontend Javascript is required to use our service, nor do we use any cookies or logging on our end 
        when you access our web server. Below is how we use your data in our server.
      </p>
      <h3 class="hashed" id="usage"><a class="hash" href="#usage">#</a> How your data is used </h3>
      <p>
        <b>If you plan on not using the bot at all and if none of your messages are linked with MsgLinks</b> - absolutely no data about you is served 
        through the bot or stored on our end.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>If you set any settings (including disabling any kind of messages)</b> - your user ID and any input (like message ID) given to the bot is stored
        on our server privately.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>When a message is served through MsgLinks</b> -  the messages data is not saved to our servers (unless it is cached), but any attachments/embeds 
        (unless disabled) and the content of your message will be served through our server.
      </p>
      <h3 class="hashed" id="prevent"><a class="hash" href="#prevent">#</a> How to prevent embedding</h3>
      <p>
        You can disable people linking your message, attachments, or any other data served through MsgLinks via <a href="/settings">our website</a> or
        via bot commands (<a href="/commands">see here</a>).
